          <h3>Memorize What You Want</h3>
          <p>After opening the app for the first time you’ll be given the option to import scripture mastery and doctrinal mastery scriptures, however, that’s just the beginning. You can import your own sets of scriptures and other text. You can even look through popular sets of scriptures made by other users.

          <h2>Funcionality</h2>
          <h3>Importing</h3>
          <p>There are loads of really simple ways to import scriptures and other text into the app. Importing your own scripture is as easy as finding a verse in the Gospel Library app, clicking the share button, and selecting the app.
          </p>

          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>The goal of Aquire is to provide users with the smoothest and most effective scripture memorization tools possible. With machine learning, Aquire gets better and better. It becomes more suited for everyone as a whole as it changes things up to see the fastest way different groups of people learn. Everyone learns at different rates but we can apply methods that have been tested on similar users to match learning speed and style. It results in taking the most effective learning experience and shapes it for the individual.</p>

          <h3>Organization</h3>
          <p>Some of the learning methods include the popular spaced repetition method, audio, and keyboard input, listening, and intelligent slicing. Aquire’s most effective method is splitting the verses into small sections overlapping. The user effectively memorizes each overlapping section via listening, reading, repeating aloud, typing, or imputing with audio. Then the pieces and parts start coming together and you see that the order of the phrases comes together. Every now and then the users will be quizzed on their past scriptures. Trouble words and areas can be highlighted and worked on at a later date. Scriptures are reviewed less and less often following the spacial repetition method allowing for you to continue to learn more as you study what you’ve already learned.

          <h2>Powerful</h2>
          <h3>Minimalist</h3>
          <p>Everything in the Aquire app is super intuitive. You can sort scriptures into folders and order the scriptures within the folders by the order in which you want to learn them. If you want to learn other things too you can store that as you wish.

          <h3>Personalization</h3>
          <p>Aquire has a lot of customizability options however we don’t let this detract from the user experience. You will notice simplicity that when you open the app it starts the learning it gets you to start learning what you want to learn as fast as possible. We take your time seriously and use every second of it effectively.

          <h2>Effective</h2>
          <h3>Time-efficient</h3>
          <p>Since the app gets you memorizing as soon as you’re in, you don’t have to worry about what to study and when. As you follow along with the different exercises you will learn the material very fast.
