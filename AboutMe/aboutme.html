            Hi there! I'm Jacob Garner. I'm working towards a software engineering degree
            and I'm excited to be taking this class. I'm sure we'll learn a lot together. 
            Take a look at some of the things I like to do!

        <h2>Favorite Pastimes!</h2>
        <h2>I love music and singing and playing the piano. I have a lot of 
            different hobbies including learning languages, programing, practicing 
            karate, working out, running, and playing sports. I grew up in a family 
            with two parents and four kids.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>

                I've lived my whole life in a tiny town in Colorado called Rye. 
                There my dad started a buisness called Piano Marvel that teaches 
                people how to play the piano with online assessments and tutorials. 
                I've been a part of that project my whole life and I've had a front 
                row seat in seeing Piano Marvel grow. That's my job right now. I 
                work with and manage the software development team. The same team 
                just remade the music player on the church website. My involvment 
                in the church has long been one of the most important aspects of my 
                life. Like just about everyone, I've always struggled with my own 
                feelings of inadequacy but I work hard to change so I can contribute 
                more to Heavenly Father's plan for his children. One problem that 
                gets to me is that I have a very reserved personality. There are a 
                lot of people that openly express themselves in front of others. 
                That's not something I've ever developed. I'm calm and reserved 
                and it can be a problem sometimes. One of my biggest fears is that 
                I might not be able to achieve all my goals. I see so many 
                limitations on who I can become. I see advantages and disadantages 
                to my reserved personality. I want to learn to be less shy and 
                improve my ability to communicate and be a positive influence.  </p>
